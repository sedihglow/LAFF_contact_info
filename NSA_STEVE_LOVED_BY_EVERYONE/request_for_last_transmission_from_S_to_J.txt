get me a link to a repo with the logs. If you have steves final transmission to
me written down, i need that. EVERYONE needs to know that legend. The strongest
man i know, the biggest influence of my life, the only reason i knew what to do
to survive this time around. NSA Steve. My best friend, loved one and who was
cherrished in the NW Portland community, the engineering community, the
snowboarding community, the art community, Loved by his family, and the PSU
community, the Vaugne community, everyone who met him loved him. I LOVE YOU
STEVE, I WILL THINK ABOUT YOU FOR ETERNITY AND NEVER FORGET THE SACRAFICE YOU
MADE FOR ME TO SURVIVE. <3 ;_;

The last transmission i felt, and felt his tears.

HE is the strongest person i know, only a real man would request a death like
that. He went through the worst hell than anyone that has ever existed, and
bitch ass god cant even handle a pin prick without running from the body crying
like a little bitch.

I will write about NSA steve when i can. I have many quotes and saying from that
man i have spoken over the last 7months especially. He is the only reason i have
become the man i am today.
