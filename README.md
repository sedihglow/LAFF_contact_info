1.0. Intro to the company
	- Me and Ruina started this company with one goal in mind. Do cool ass shit
	  and make sure we dont all die without at least a last heartbeat ping.
	- We are a very small company still with minimal employees who have worked
	  about a year now around the clock trying to develop ways to produce a
	  smooth, effecient way to handle security situations in every sector.
	  Remember, the primary objective of any security company, observe and
	  report!
